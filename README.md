# WeatherStationSchoolProject
Main idea was transferring data (from arduino to Raspberry pi to database to C# application)

This is my second years first project and it was accomplished by the group of three;
me,
Henri Haukipuro - https://github.com/Henkahau
Valtteri Impola (who yet hasn't got own github profile).
